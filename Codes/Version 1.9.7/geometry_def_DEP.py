This code defines geoemtrical elements by a set of points. It also calculates the 
normal vector for each surface of that geometry. 

Definition parameters:
    - In geo_pointsX() functions, the point array set p_wall[] contains the edge point of each geometry element
    - All numbers in the geo_pointsX() functions are in microns (um)

Outputs:
    - n_vector_set: Normal vectors for all the walls n = (a,b,c), n_vector_set = [(a1,b1,c1), (a2,b2,c2)....]. Size = (Nwalls,3)
    - d_set       : Set of d coefficients defining the wall planes ax + by + cz = d. Size (Nwalls,)
    - p_lim_set   : x,y,z limist for each wall. p_lim_1 = [xlow_1, xhigh_1, ylow_1, yhigh_1, zlow_1, zhigh_1], p_lim_set = [p_lim_1,p_lim_2....]. Size (Nwalls,6)   
    
    - Here, Nwalls = number of walls

- May 17, 2021: 
    - Added different geometry segment types (rectangular, triangular etc.)
    - Implemented call function by string 
    - Functionalized different parts
